Andres Freund is a software engineer who lives in Germany, he is known as the internets final boss, because he apretty much saved the internet.


While he was using debian Sid he noticed something weird,why was ssh using such a vast amount of recrouces?
There was also a minor but consistent delay in ssh, half a second.
He found it annoying and couldn't make sense of it. So he started looking deeper...

He realises the delay is related to XZ utils, after further research he finds a carefully hidden backdoor. It was so well hidden, that no one saw it during testing and reviewing. This backdoor was on sersion 5.6 and 5.6.1 of xz utils

Andres Freund then went public with his findings.

When he released his findings all hell breaks loose, the US cyberdefence agency issues an emergency security alert. The backdoor was just on the verge of massive deployment, it had already hit test versions of many Linux distros. it could have had a drastic impact, the attackers could have gained access to countless systems and servers, a master key

So now the question remains; from where and who is Jia Tan


Let's start with whom she worked with and the kind of attack it was.  
It was a social engineering attack, since the attackers manipulated other people for their purposes.
Ens and Kumar  pressured Colin, and thus made way for Tan.
Jia made a positive reputation for herself by commiting to many projects. Jia Tan tried to build trust with colin,
Mysoeater and Krygorin urged those at debian to push update through.

THis attack took years.


Data suggests she was located in the utc+8 timezone, but faking timezones isn't hard.
